This repo gives a detailed documentation to the data and paper "Intelligent Bidding Strategies for Prosumers in Local Energy Markets Based on Reinforcement Learning" that is currently in review with IEEE ACCESS. 
The detailed documentation and code will be updated once the paper is accepted for publication.
The simulation data is already added for public use. 


#Data description

This profile is the data of a typical German housesold for a period of one year. The data is in 15 minutes time step. It is classified into consumers and prosumers. Consumers are household with only load devices while prosumers are household with load and pv devices. The data is a houseold profile and thus mat not require detailed documentation. For each profile, we have time and power in watt. The time is the 15 min time step when the power was consumed.
